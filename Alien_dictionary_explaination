Compared 'i'th index word with the 'i+1'th index word. E.g:- Suppose 'abc' comes before 'dbc' therefore an edge from a to d exists. 

Therefore, a will come before d in the topologically sorted order for the constructed graph.

Another example:- aba comes before abc , therefore an edge from a to c exists.
